Hi, I'm Klara! 🙋🏼‍♀️ 

Even though I label myself as a graphic designer, I enjoy many things besides "traditional" graphic design. I'm kind of letting life decide my destination. 

That said, I can offer my clients a full spectrum of services. I do vector illustrations, but I can also draw and paint on more or less traditional materials. I also learned some basics of photography, and I do photo editing.

That leads to many of my hobbies. I sew, crochet, tattoo, do makeup, do nail art, sculpt and even upcycle old furniture. I don't care what it is as long it's creative I will enjoy it.
