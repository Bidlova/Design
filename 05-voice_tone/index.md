# Voice & Tone

Voice
The most important aspect of communication for me is to be kind to each other. Communicating especially about business stuff can be sometimes full of emotions, but that doesn't mean we donâ€™t have to be kind. We are all only humans. Another important aspect of communication is honesty. I will be honest with you and say if I don't like something. I expect the same from you. Only with honesty, we can be on the same page. And last but not least I like to stay professional in some way. Giving my client the feeling of comfort in trusting me and my work.
