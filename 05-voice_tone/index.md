## Voice & Tone

# Voice
The most important aspect of communication for me is to be kind to each other. Communicating especially about business stuff can be sometimes full of emotions, but that doesn't mean we donâ€™t have to be kind. We are all only humans. Another important aspect of communication is honesty. I will be honest with you and say if I don't like something. I expect the same from you. Only with honesty, we can be on the same page. And last but not least I like to stay professional in some way. Giving my client the feeling of comfort in trusting me and my work.
1. Kind 
2. Honest  
3. Profesional

# Tone
In my tone, I like to stay optimistic even in dark times. The optimistic approach can calm people down and let them think clearly. The same goes for humor if it's the right time a bit of humor never killed anybody and can make someone's day. This all while being respectful. One of the worst feelings at work is not being respected so I try to be respectful to others all the time.
1. Optimistic
2. Humorous
3. Respectful

# Style
Write like you are reading it on the other side. If you don't like to read something in your communication, don't write like that to others. I believe in mirroring, so if you act kind and respectful to others, they will be the same to you. I think society needs to learn that.
